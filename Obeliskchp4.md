When the dwarf looked around to the other side of the pedestal, she was met with the slope of a half dozen gentle steps leading up to another room that seemed to be made from unnatural curves and waves. This room was presided over by a stone female wearing what seemed to the dwarf to be a campfire for a headdress. Her gown, which should have been a flowing affair to Jodi’s sensibilities, also seemed to draw inspiration from the shapes a flame makes. The statue also held out her arms but she held a bowl in her hands, the contents of which were similar to the goat man’s in that it was another arrow, but this one was all the colors of an inferno; reds and yellows, even hints of green, white, and blue.

The dwarf had no idea what she was looking at, but she thought the whole thing beautiful. There was a magic in the air here, not the storybook lovey-dovey magic of romance –although, there did seem to be a dash of that as well– but, very strong spell magic. 

While Jodi took in the room, Lira’s attention had been fixed on the glyphs at their feet. The pedestal they entered on had an extension that ran about 5 feet toward the elk’s head and raised at a 45° angle in front of them. On it were a series of glyphs like the ones she had just used her skill on in the other room. She looked at Aimon and asked, “should I use Decipher on these as well?”

“That won’t be necessary,” he answered with a chuckle. 

Seeing her quizzical look at his response, he continued, “there is a myth –a very obscure and old myth– that is handed down through a sort of…” he faltered here, not knowing how to put the idea into words “...blood wisdom, I guess it could be called. If you were an elf, you wouldn’t be able to understand the words I’m about to say if your bloodline wasn’t of the first elders, hence you need a ‘blood wisdom’ to hear the myth.” he concluded.

“In the time before the races of this world emerged, there were just the empires of the elements. Fire, Wind, Water, Ice, Wood, Earth, and more. All had their separate kingdoms and largely kept to themselves except for one night each year when the planets aligned, the rulers of each of the element’s domains gathered and traded ideas for the direction the world would take.”

“Nothing ever came from these meetings from what I understand. Each of the elements thirsted for more power but was kept in check by the others. A perfect balance had been struck long before any sentient being emerged from any of the elemental empires. That is until the heirs of Popocatépetl and Itztlacoliuhqui saw each other at one of these meetings and fell deeply in love with one another. You see, one was of ice, he gestured at the statue on the left, and one was of lava, he pointed at the one on the right. As you can probably imagine, the union was doomed to fail as, every time they approached one another, the other began to dissipate in response to its opposite element. The youths would not accept this state of affairs and caused devastation as their efforts to be together tore at the edges of, not only their element’s empires, but bled out into the domain of the others.” 

“Seeing how these two were causing the intricate balance they had created to tilt dangerously toward chaos, the elders created the mother river. Her waters did not freeze even in the coldest winds and they did not turn to steam even in the hottest fires. In fact, none of the elements had any effect at all on the mother river. The elders invited the two lovers to be together in its waters and it's said they still reside there today, in each other’s embrace until the end of eternity,” the elf finished the tale with a wistful look of reverence in his eyes. 

Even the cynical dwarf seemed to be taken by the romance of the tale and did not have her usual retort of disgust for such things. Lira, while completely enamored with the story, immediately made the connection to the puzzle presented by the rooms, channel, and elk. 

“It’s how to solve the puzzle!” she exclaimed, clapping her hands excitedly. 

“That is correct, child,” Aimon said in his best Lionel impression.

While meant to be funny, the thought of the druid battling while they partook in the whimsy of the legend brought all three adventurers crashing back down to earth. 

“We need to hurry, Lionel needs us to finish this quickly,” Lira voiced the sentiment they all felt. 

“Okay, sae whit dae we dae ?” asked Jodi.

Lira looked at Aimon, a question in her eyes. Whether she needed a translation of Jodi’s question or just wanted to know the nuts and bolts of the puzzle’s solution, he wasn’t sure, but it didn’t matter.

Lionel produced his bow, said “Elder arrow” and released the bowstring where a translucent elk's head had appeared in place of the sharp tip. The likeness flew towards its stone doppelganger and struck directly between its giant antlers. The result was instantaneous, a deluge of water flowed forth from the stone elk’s mouth, filling the channel in seconds even as the water raged past them underneath the pedestal. 

In response to the elf’s actions, both sides of the chamber began to change. The floors on each side began to take on their element’s characteristics. Aimon went for the ice element statue first but he quickly found out that stepping on the icy floor caused near-instant freezing of his limbs. He fell back towards the girls as soon as his first step landed in response to the pain of his foot freezing. In a stroke of luck, he had led with his right foot and the frozen limb splashed into the river created by the stone elk as the girls struggled to catch his larger frame. The water cleansed the frost in a matter of seconds, leaving the three adventurers in slack-jawed amazement. 

“Clever,” deadpanned the elf. 

After a moment, he looked at Lira and said, “Decipher the glyphs.” 

She muttered “Decipher” and read the result back to the elf. “Reach out to the Elder for the maternal gift. To reunite the lovers, allow her embrace to surround you in her loving protection.”

Aimon thought about the words for a moment trying to parse their meaning. Jodi, on the other hand, was staring at him incredulously. “Jump intae th' cooncil juice ye beardless eejit,” she said like she was talking to the dumbest person on the continent. 

“Why would I jump into the water, Jodi?” he asked, but the answer had already begun to occur to him as he spoke. 

“Of course, the mother’s embrace, well done!” Aimon exclaimed. “ …and I may be beardless but I’m not an idiot, I would have figured it out eventually, you rotten dwarf,” he added before jumping into the waters, catching himself on the side of the pedestal. 

“Rotten Dwarf?” Jodi scoffed while fighting the urge to mash Aimon’s fingers under the heel of her boot. Luckily Lira’s melodic giggle served to curb her annoyance. In the next moment, the elf was pulling himself back onto the pedestal, dripping water. The wetness was strange though, it seemed to extend slightly from the elf, almost like a razor-thin suit of liquid armor. 

Without a word, the elf bounded off through the room on the left, grabbed the arrow the statue held and was back on the pedestal. To the absolute amazement of both girls, he returned completely dry, like the dip he took in the water not 15 seconds ago had never happened. The protective liquid seemed to have been burned away as it protected him. Aimon chuckled at the simplicity and was back in and out of the strange river in an excited heartbeat. He nodded to himself as he emerged and braved the burning floor of the right side chamber as fast as his prodigious elven dexterity would carry him. If Jodi or Lira had blinked, they may have missed him. The immediate danger the lava-like floor presented seemed to have provided some extra motivation for swiftness in the elf. 

He contemplated the two arrows for a moment with a confused look on his face. “Should I just toss them in the water?” he asked the girls.

Both returned incredulous stares in his direction before realizing there wasn’t really another option. 

Refusing to be so barbaric with the representation of the two lovers, Lira suggested, “maybe just hold them under the water together?” 

Aimon considered the option. He felt ridiculous but couldn’t argue that respect for the myth and its players felt, inexplicably, like the right thing to do, so, without giving it too much more thought, he plunged the two arrows into the water below them. 

The answer was instantaneous. The elk’s head stopped supplying the water into the channel and stretched towards them with the gnashing sound of a rock slide. As it approached their pedestal, it lowered its muzzle in a motion mimicking a bow. The enormous antlers encased the group and a small platform on the back of the elk’s head was exposed. It contained a beautiful bow. 

Lira wasn’t an expert on bows, or any weapon really, but even she could recognize the mastery that went into this one’s construction. The upper and lower limbs were a vibrant brown like the polished grand piano from city hall back home, except they had a beautiful golden filigree decorating their entire length and, the closer she looked, the more the bow seemed to be made of metal instead of the wood she had thought at first glance. 

“The hand of Cernunnos,” Aimon breathed reverently.

“A'richt, stoatin. Let’s git oot o' 'ere, th' annoying auldjin is huvin a' th' fin oot thare ,” said Jodi, pointing over her shoulder with her thumb, completely unaffected by the magical bow that had so enthralled the other two. 

“Yes, you’re right, let’s go,” Aimon responded, grabbing up the bow and turning to leave. As soon as he removed the bow from its perch, a status update appeared in his vision.

Aimon swallowed hard. The bow was more than he ever could have expected from the legends his father had told him. While he expected it to be powerful, and it definitely was that, he had not known that the bow came with unique skills or that those skills would be as dominating as what he was reading. The amount of power granted to him through the class synergy was something his brain could not compute properly, causing him to freeze in shock instead of turning to follow the two young girls.

“Aimon! C’mon!” Lira yelled. “Lionel is fighting all alone!” 

Her words jerked him from his reverie and he followed hastily and without any response to Lira’s chastisement. He joined the girls in the circle of glyphs as Lira, who had barely waited for him to enter, began to recite the strange words again. 

The scene greeting them upon their return seized all three hearts in a vice-like grip of despair.
