Joyce, call me as soon as possible. 911. Emergency.

  

He pressed send with a trembling hand. His nerves were so shot at this point he felt like the last strand of fabric holding an old threadbare sweater together. His eyes kept darting to the phone to make sure he hadn’t missed her response. He wasn’t sure he would feel the vibration with the way his hands were trembling.

  

After 30 seconds, he couldn’t wait any longer. All he could think to do was check and see if the creature was still out there or not. Perhaps this was all in his imagination, maybe even a dream. He wrote off that last possibility, he didn’t dream like this. He was much more confident in the mental breakdown explanation.

  

He could imagine himself in the fetal position, bloody and beaten, while Jack went on a murderous rampage in the chicken coop. Laying there, unable to move, his mind broken and creating this insanity to cope. That would explain why–

  

The thought was interrupted by the buzzing vibration of his phone.

  

I’m at work, are you ok?

  

What’s wrong, I get off in 30

  

Damn! He had forgotten she was working. Thirty minutes!?

  

“C’mon Zach, you can keep it together for 30 damn minutes,” he muttered to himself, touching the top of his closed fist to his forehead a few times to drive home the point.

  

He opened the text app with a shaky press of the green icon and sent his reply.

  

Come over immediately after you’re done. It’s defcon 1 important.

  

He wasn’t the type for histrionics so he hoped she realized the seriousness of the situation. He wasn’t sure what to do with himself now. Texting Joyce had been the only viable option when he was considering a course of action.

  

He began to pace while thoughts whirled through his mind like a dust devil in the desert. As he reached the end of his room for the third time in the circuit he was pacing, before he turned around, he looked up to see his reflection in the mirror on the back of his door. He was filthy. Dirt, grime, even some of Jack’s blood stained almost every inch of his person. The only clean spots seemed to be the tracks his angry tears had made. He didn’t even remember crying. Jack was never going to let him forget that.

  

Ok, he thought. I need a shower and a great way to waste some time too, so let’s do that.

He immediately felt better now that he had something to do. Idle hands were already his nemesis, causing his thoughts to race and his ADHD to really exert itself in his mind. He’d found that just having a task in front of him was sometimes just as effective as his meds, if not more so.

  

Ixanae watched the boy with amusement. Their bond gave him a sixth-sense vision of Zach and his surroundings. He could see the room, he could read the texts, and he even got a vague sense of Zach’s plan to take a shower. Ixanae wondered how the next few hours would go now that he had been forced to show himself before he was ready.

  

The big lad had thwarted any plans for a meeting Ixanae had entertained before he really even had a chance to come up with a good one. One thing about this bond he and Zach shared –that he had just learned the hard way– was that if one of them was in danger, the other was compelled to help them out of instinct. “Just like how a mother will protect her child without a second thought,” Ixanae mused to the trees.

  

—------------------

  

Zach had spent much longer than he normally did in the shower. His mind was still coming apart at the edges, so he didn’t know exactly what time he’d gotten in, but still, it was way longer than normal. He grabbed his phone and checked to see how long it had been since Joyce had texted him last.

  

25 minutes.

  

“Damn, she’ll take at least ten minutes to drive here,” he said to the room. He decided he need to calm himself down before she arrived anyway. He googled “meditation for relaxation” and picked a random video on youtube. He closed his eyes, rested his hands on his lap, and followed along with the guidance provided by the gentle feminine voice.

  

Before he knew it, he felt a tap on his shoulder. He had gotten so into the meditation, he had fallen asleep head splayed back across the top of his desk chair, mouth wide open. His first thought was of how many spiders he had eaten. The second, a self-rebuke for his weirdness.

  

“Zach, what’s the matter?” Joyce said breathlessly.

  

He could tell she had rushed to get here. A wave of gratitude swept through his chest as he responded, “Joyce, I need you to keep an open mind while I tell you, ok? You’re not going to believe me at first but I swear this is the god’s honest truth.”

  

She raised an eyebrow at him. “Go on,” she lead.

  

He proceeded to tell her the story. Even while telling it, he sensed that it quickly devolved into an incoherent mess. His recently relaxed nerves quickly were on edge again as he relived the events he was describing. Joyce wore an expression of open contempt as he went through the bullying part of the story. She hated Jack with a passion for the way he treated Zach, but it barely registered with him as he continued.

  

When he hit the part about the dog coming up from behind him, she gasped audibly. Zach chuckled mirthlessly. “You haven’t heard the worst part yet, Joyce,” he lamented.

  

Her whole countenance flipped to one of complete indignation when he went on to explain what happened next. “Zachary Brian Phillips, please tell me you did not call me over here for an emergency to tell me a fairy tale about a talking dog as a joke,” she seethed.

  

“Joyce, I’m not kidding,” he replied, head down, gazing at his floor.

  

Zach was not above the occasional practical joke, but Joyce knew him well, and he was not the type of person that would take it too far. His serious tone combined with his body language gave her a very bad feeling.

  

She was silent in thought for a few moments then simply said, “Show me.”

  

Zach gave a jerk of surprise. “I am not going out there just to show you, Joyce. The thing is gigantic and could easily tear us both to bits. Look!” He dragged her over to the window and pointed out where the giant dog sat regally, head held high as if he was showing off for the two of them.

  

“Wow, he is a biggun’,” she said. “Ok, I see what you mean. How ‘bout we just go on the deck for a minute and see if he’ll come over to us?”

  

Zach considered for a moment. He was a wuss, he knew it, she knew it, –heck– everyone knew it! But he had called Joyce just for this reason. He needed some sort of resolution to this mess before his parents got home. If going out there and trying to talk to the talking dog –he shook his head at the insanity of those words– was the only way to move forward then, he had to do it.

  

“Ok, let’s go,” he said, unable to keep the hesitation out of his voice.

  

“Oh Zach, buck up man. If you really stumbled on to a giant talking dog that protects you, then you have just become the protagonist of like every single story that I’ve ever read. It will be friggin’ amazing!” she laughed. Even in the excitement of her words, Zach could sense that she still didn’t believe him. He couldn’t blame her. His story was wild. Fortunately, he had a feeling her tune would change on a dime in just a few short minutes.

  

—-----------------------------

  

Ixanae was on the move before the children even left the bedroom. This would do nicely, he thought. He was mildly worried about exposing himself to another human other than his bond, but he sensed the trust and friendship between the two of them and decided it was worth it to move this process along.

  

Zach did not seem inclined to learn about him in the way that Ixanae had heard that bonds usually did. He didn’t know if the elders had been misinformed, lying, or what, but this bond seemed like he would rather run 100 miles in the opposite direction than explore the pull he was feeling in his soul toward Ixanae.

  

Ixanae didn’t think the child had even recognized the bond over the fear and anxiety their interaction from earlier had caused him. He found himself thankful for the female child as he approached the porch. She would be a good conduit for Zach to recognize and embrace the bond.

  

Ixanae arrived well before they did, so he sat and patiently waited about 20 feet from the raised porch. He also positioned himself on the side opposite the steps, if only to give the boy less reason to panic. Ixanae wondered idly if he’d ever heard of a bond human as fearful and scared as his was turning out to be. It was of no matter really, they would grow together, but the starting point seemed to be unique, and not in a good way.

  

“Heyyyy there, big fella,” came the girl’s wispy voice, spoken like she was talking to an angry rhinoceros.

  

“Heyyy there, little girl,” Ixanae mimicked. He knew he shouldn’t antagonize these children, but he couldn’t help himself.

  

The girl child gave a squeak like a startled squirrel and took a few involuntary steps back.

  

—-----------

  

“Zachary! It spoke, did you hear that?” Joyce whisper-shouted.

  

Zach just nodded at her like she was stupid. “Isn’t that what I just got finished telling you not five minutes ago, Joyce?” he replied incredulously.

  

Her eyes were wide as dinner plates. Blue with brown flakes, Zach thought to himself reflexively. “I–,” she tried to start, but her words seemed to stick in her mouth. She cleared her throat and tried again, “I obviously didn’t believe you, Zach, would you believe me if I said I could talk to animals!?”

  

Zach sighed. He couldn’t blame her, he supposed. His story was a bit farcical. He probably wouldn’t have believed it either if he hadn’t lived it.

  

“Zach, My name is Ixanae. I am a cynanthrope and your bond. It is a pleasure to meet you,” the dog said.

  

He and Joyce stared with matching looks of astonishment on their faces. Zach tried to reply, but the words kept getting caught before they reached his mouth. A what? My bond? What kind of name is that? His mind felt broken, like he was on drugs or something, or maybe really drunk. Either way, he found it exceedingly difficult to function at the moment.

  

Joyce was the first to recover. “Uh– nice to meet you, Ick–, Im sorry, wha– what was your name again?” she stuttered.

  

“Icks–ah–nay,” the cynanthrope pronounced, emphasizing each syllable slowly.

  

“Nice to meet you, Ixanae,” Joyce said, her voice having regained her normal confidence again. “Can I–, we –I mean– ask you some questions?” she managed.

  

“Of course,” Ixanae said nodding his giant head.

  

“What’s that thing you called yourself?” Zach blurted without thinking. He recoiled as he realized that he might have insulted the beast.

  

“Zachary, first of all, I’m not a beast. My brethren would consider being called such an insult, I understand you are not insulting me, but please refrain from calling me that moving forward. I am a cynanthrope. There are many myths and legends about my race, but none of them are true. In the interest of keeping things brief, suffice to say we are a race the creator’s tasked with humanity’s protection,” Ixanae said with a regal calm.

  

Zach had turned a pale shade of green at the realization that this thing had just read his thoughts which also happened to be an insult to its people.

  

“I–, I’m–, I’m sorry,” Zach forced out.

  

Joyce just looked at him questioningly then it seemed to dawn on her what the interaction was all about. “You can read our minds!?” she nearly shouted.

  

“No. I can only sense Zach’s thoughts normally, but they are so charged with emotion now it’s like he’s speaking them out loud to me. He is my bond,” Ixanae said like this was the most normal thing in the world.

  

“Ok, listen Ixanae. There is obviously a lot of talking that needs to happen so we can understand what the hell is going on, but we can’t do it here and we definitely can’t let anyone else see you or they’ll call animal control or the police…or both,” Joyce explained.

  

“I do not know these terms or their meaning,” Ixanae replied.

  

“They’re…,” Joyce hesitated, trying to find the best way to describe what animal control and/or the police would mean for him, “...they are people who will try to capture or hurt you,” she finally said, deciding on simplicity over details.

  

“That would be unfortunate for them,” the cynanthrope stated calmly.

  

“It would be unfortunate for us!!” Zach screeched in a voice that betrayed his panic. “You need to get out of here! My parents will be home soon, Jack probably called someone about you already. Who knows who’s on their way!? You need to leave!”

  

“Zachary Brian Philips!” scolded Joyce. “Settle down! You are being ridiculous.”

  

Her admonishment silenced Zach so completely he didn’t even have a thought run through his head. “Ixanae, while my friend here is a walking, talking overreaction right now, he’s not wrong. We need to get you somewhere you won’t be seen while we figure out what the heck is going on,” she continued with a dismissive gesture in Zach’s direction.

  
  
  

Ixanae considered the girl’s words. He could see the truth in them. “Would it help if I shifted into one of the domestic breeds that so many of you humans keep as pets?” he asked.

  

“YES!” both teenagers replied simultaneously. Neither one considering the absurdity of such a possibility in the face of the impossibility of the last few minutes.

  

“This is not a problem. What breed would you prefer?”
