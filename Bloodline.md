Laura sat motionless, staring at the yellowing paper in her hand.  It felt brittle like spun sugar, ready to crumble at the slightest provocation.  She had found it moments before in one of her grandmother’s books from what the matriarch had referred to as her “rebellious” phase.  

Laura was trying her best to square the woman she had known her entire life with the one who would have written something so…strange.  Before the cancer had stolen her faculties, her grandmother had often spoken of a time in her life when she had conducted herself in ways that would make her family cringe–but witchcraft? Laura would have never expected the proper, conservative old woman to have dabbled in such things.  

But here she was, reading the unmistakable cursive of her grandmother’s hand with its old-fashioned sloping script. What was even more jarring than the content of the missive was the fact that it was addressed to Laura.  

She was only 23 years old.  This paper had to be double that, at the very least.  Like any self-respecting sane person, her first instinct was that her grandmother had added her name sometime in the last few months as she wasted away on her deathbed.  Laura realized right away that that explanation was improbable, if not impossible.  For one, her grandmother was, literally, dying from stage four lung cancer, and she could barely move.  A journey into the attic from her bedroom downstairs might as well have been to the moon for all that she could accomplish it.  Secondly, the ink looked as old as the paper itself, there was no way this thing had been penned in the last 30 years, let alone the last 30 days.  

While the mystery of how and why Laura’s name had made it onto a piece of paper that seemed older than her was utterly baffling, the fact that it implored her to brew a potion purported to resurrect her grandmother’s spirit –that would then provide critical information that Laura desperately needed– was causing her brain to feel like it needed to be turned off and back on again.  

“How…” she muttered to the room, fully expecting to wake up or maybe for one of her brothers to pop out of somewhere with a completely tone-deaf “gotcha”.  Unfortunately, neither of those things happened, even after another 15 minutes of considering the old parchment. 

“This is mental.  I can’t deal with this right now,” she decided all at once. She threw the paper back into the book in the same motion that she tossed the book back onto the top of an old trunk.  A plume of dust exploded from its landing zone causing her to cough as she inhaled some of the particles. 

“Pick it back up.” 

She didn’t quite hear the words.  It was more like she felt them in the fabric of her being.  But, the meaning was unmistakable as was the sender.  For lack of a better description, she sensed her grandmother’s aura behind the words and knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that she wouldn’t be allowed to disregard the command easily.  

“Nana?” she found herself asking the room.  “Are you here?” 

She felt utterly ridiculous. She didn’t believe in ghosts or spirits.  She thought religion, at least the organized versions, were a farce.  Her mind must be coping with the grief of losing her grandmother with minor hallucinations.  While not ideal, having a minor disagreement with reality was a much easier explanation to swallow than the spirit of her dead grandmother speaking to her through the veil. 

She let out a manic giggle as she mentally wrote off this whole experience as some sort of mental health issue, but it was cut off by the overwhelming sense of anger she felt directed at her from some unseen force that felt entirely too much like her grandmother.  It was like she could almost hear the admonishment and accompanying demand to take the letter seriously in the silence of the room. 

Incredulous, Laura felt herself becoming angry.  “Nana, I am not going to make some stupid potion, from some stupid old paper, that I found in this stupid attic, in some stupid old book!” she snarled.  The thought of what she must look like arguing with an empty room momentarily brought her back in contact with normalcy, but that was quickly shattered when she felt the crushing weight that demanded she follow the directions laid out in the note. 

She was too frazzled and tired to fight this fight anymore. “Fine,” she huffed and grabbed up the book again.  The note didn’t specify what exactly this concoction was supposed to do.  It only said that “after you drink it, I can help you”, whatever the hell that meant.  

Why in the world her grandmother had some of the things listed as ingredients in her pantry –Laura had the urge to open it the second she crossed into the kitchen– was beyond her.  Adder’s tongue? A child’s eyelashes? Everything about this seemed so off-the-wall unbelievable it was a wonder Laura didn’t just run screaming from the house.  She couldn’t stop though, she just knew somehow that this had to be done and that she would understand it later.  

It was in this state of mind that she found herself outside in the December cold, building a fire because, apparently, she wasn’t allowed to use anything but a wood fire to brew this batshit crazy potion.  She felt like two people trapped in one body.  One doing as she was told and the other rebelling as hard as she could against the insanity of “being told” to do something by a dead person’s essence.  

Having a fire did, at least, take the bite out of the cold winter air.  She had placed the blue stock pot on a grate over the flames and was now watching the brownish-green sludge bubble violently as it boiled.  The paper said she was supposed to wait another ten minutes past this point.  At least it doesn’t smell too bad, she thought as she sat down on a log to wait.  

She found herself staring, mesmerized by the flickering blue flames, into the fire while remembering the woman who had raised her—the woman who eschewed horoscopes, tarot cards, psychics, and such, as scams and quackery. “Shit,” she said, startled by the waaaaaaaaaaa, waaaaaaaaa, waaaaaaaaa of her phone alarm going off at the end of the ten-minute timer.  

The smell wafting off of her grandmother’s potion reminded her of a forest after heavy rain. She had been afraid it was going to be really nasty but, if the smell was anything to judge by, it wouldn’t be that bad. She consulted the hastily scribbled copy of the note she had made before coming out here and the only step left was to drink it.  She poured the sludge into a mug sporting one of those day-of-the-dead skeleton masks and steeled herself. 

“Alright, Nana,” she said to the liquid after letting it cool for a few minutes.  “This better not be some ploy to kill me so you won’t be alone on the other side.” And with that, she chugged the concoction like she was drinking an Irish car bomb with her friends from college.  

The effect was instant. 

She turned to see an ethereal outline of her grandmother forming from the smoke from the fire. “Goodness, you are stubborn, Bug,” the apparition said. 

“Nana!?” Laura replied incredulously. 

“Yes, dear.  Now listen to me, for the potion does not last long and there is much I need to tell you.” 

“Nana??” Laura exclaimed again as tears began to stream down her face. 

“Laura Ann Fleming! I need you to pull yourself together this instant.  You will not suffer the same fate as your mother while I am still able to do something about it!” her grandmother admonished with more rage than Laura had ever seen her express when she was alive. 

“My mother?” Laura asked. The mention of her long-dead mom broke the spell of emotion that had taken hold. 

“Yes, Bug. Our family is part of an ancient bloodline whose women were tasked by the ancient creators to keep a specific evil at bay.  We were given access to the magic that made this world to accomplish our given role and, for millennia, we have used it to combat his influence over this world.  

“But, something changed when your mother was born.  Somehow, he was able to find a backdoor through our protections and he was able to influence us both as you were being born.  I was able to extend the power I’d gained over the course of my life to protect your mother from him in the short-term–” 

“You keep saying he and him, who are you talking about,” Laura interrupted.  

“I’ll get to that Bug, just listen for now,” her grandmother answered, a wispy hand cupping Laura’s cheek.

“I was able to protect your mother until she gave birth to you,” she began again. “I didn’t know that the magic of creating a new life would weaken your mother so much that it would allow Ageroth the opportunity to attack but, even if I had, there was no other alternative.” 

“I thought I could hide her.  I couldn’t.  I had foreseen your coming many years before and knew that you would be powerful –that is why I wrote that letter as a girl–” she gestured at the paper Laura still had in her hands, “but I never saw the sacrifice your mother would make to save you.  I would have done things differently if I would have known what we would face at that moment.” 

The tears were flowing down Laura’s cheeks again. She had come to terms with being the reason for her mom’s death.  She had always harbored a festering anger toward the woman for getting knocked up and carrying such a risky pregnancy to term.  She had done her research and knew that every doctor would have advised her to terminate.  The chances of her dying during delivery were upwards of 90%. 

Her grandmother seemed to sense her thoughts.  “She did not pass giving birth to you, Bug.  The power of creating a new life –while weakening me– broke whatever chains he had placed around her and she fought him tooth and nail when he came.  I tried to help but she implored…,” she paused, “...demanded is a better word, for me to protect you instead.  I couldn’t save you both, so I did as she asked.  

“Her power, combined with yours, was extraordinary once it was released, but it was unwieldy and difficult for her to use effectively.  I knew how the fight would end, but I honored her wishes. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.

“I knew I couldn’t defeat him, but I knew how to hide us from him.  I bound our powers into that spell paper you found and lived as normally –and non-magically– as I could possibly manage.  

“You see, when I was a girl I had a vision of you and me living without our family’s magic.  I didn’t know what happened to my daughter or why we were living that way, but I understood the message.  I had to write that letter you found so that you could bring me back to guide you.” 

Laura felt like a walking, talking exploding head emoji.  “How come this is the first I’m hearing about this, Nana?” she asked, her tone coming out sharp and angry.  

“Our power is a part of us, Bug.  If you were even to consider that you had it –even for a moment– it would have responded, and he would have found you.  I had no other choice than to keep you as far from the supernatural as I possibly could.” 

Laura considered this for a moment and decided that she was more concerned with finding out about her mother’s murderer.  “Tell me about him.” 

Her grandmother’s spirit sighed.  “He is an ancient, primordial evil that came with the creation of everything.  I don’t want to get too philosophical, but suffice it to say that you can’t have good without bad.  Do you understand?” 

“Sure…love couldn’t exist without hate to define it against, right?” Laura answered. 

“Exactly.  And this is true for all things.  Ageroth is the manifestation of the evil half of the scales.  He is greed to our generosity.  He is corruption to our honesty.  Our bloodline had kept him at bay and the world in balance for millennia, but he was able to affect your delivery somehow.  After that, the balance was lost and the world descended into the chaos you see today.  

I knew the time would come when I would die and the last vestiges of his workings would die with me, allowing you to realize the full potential of our ancestors, and I knew that I needed to be there for you from this side when the time came, hence the letter,” her grandmother finished.  Then a fierceness took over her features and she growled, “Now we must train so that you can put that monster back in his place.”
