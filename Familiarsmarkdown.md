The lightning exploded on the backs of Zeke’s closed eyelids as the back of a meaty hand connected with his temple.  

“You little pansy.  Who keeps chickens in the middle of a city…and doesn’t even eat them?” Jack, whose personal mission in life for the last three years was to make Zeke’s existence as miserable as possible, taunted.

Zeke had long ago learned that fighting back, or responding in any way really, led to a more prolonged and vicious beat down from this oaf.  He’d learned those lessons the hard way with blood and bruises. 

Nope, no more reactions for Zeke, now his tried and true,  go-to strategy for all bullying interactions with Jack was the patented “cower in the fetal position” move that had led to the least amount of pain overall in his experience.

This interaction had played out so many times it was down to a science in Zeke’s mind.  So much so that he nearly didn’t hear the next taunt that changed everything.

Jack snapped his fingers as if an idea just occurred to him, “ you’ve been saving to thank me for letting you live all these years, huh? You know how much I love chicken! That’s so sweet of you Zeke. In fact, I think I’m in the mood for chicken…”  he let the thought trail off into the abyss as he began to stalk menacingly toward the coop.  

Zeke’s thoughts became frantic after glancing at the coop and realized Jack had caught him before he put the lock back on the door. All he could think was his girls were at Jack’s mercy and there was nothing he could do.

He had spent a lot of years on the receiving end of Jack’s bullying and, in some corner of his mind, he understood why a muscle-bound, sports-obsessed, jackass like Jack felt the need to assert dominance over someone like him.  But he wouldn’t stand idly by while Jack killed one of his girls, he just wouldn’t. He couldn’t.

It had been so long since Jack had made Zeke react to being picked on that he sat, slack-jawed in disbelief, when the skinny boy rose defiantly to his feet, blood trickling down the cut on his cheek. 

“Leave my chickens alone, Jack,” Zeke growled quietly.

Jack’s face twisted in anger with the challenge and replied, “your chickens?”

Zeke planned to respond but, out of the corner of his eye, he caught movement in the treeline that butted up to his family’s property which pulled his attention away for a moment.  He glanced quickly and could have sworn he saw a dog darting through the undergrowth. The brief pause gave Jack the opening he seemed to want. 

“So, you claim my chickens and think it’s ok to ignore me when I’m talking to you?” Jack tsked in mock disappointment as he began to stroll toward the coop.

Zeke didn’t think, he just reacted.  In the instant he felt Jack turn toward his girls, he darted in front of the bully and screamed “STOP!” while putting his hands on his chest.  Jack pulled up momentarily and glanced down at the hands.  When he looked back up, his grin promised pain.

The thoughts in Zeke’s head were moving at a frantic pace.  He had no options, he couldn’t stop Jack, his parents weren’t home, and his hens were going to die because he was so weak. On top of all that, the promised beating in Jack’s eyes was terrifying.  The panic caused his breathing to become ragged, his heart to beat too hard and fast, and his limbs started to go numb. Am I dying? He thought.

  And then, like a soft breeze gently pulling leaves in autumn, a voice as clear and deep as a mountain lake rumbled over his panicked thoughts, leaving a sense of purpose and courage in its wake. 

“Hit him.” 

Had Zeke considered the voice’s proposed action, he would have quickly come to the conclusion that this was folly.  He would be pummeled immediately, and then his chickens would be murdered anyway.  

But he didn’t consider at all, he focused on the beacon of calm confidence that had just rung through his head, wound up, and let his fist fly towards Jack’s nose.  

For Jack, the sheer surprise of a punch being thrown from this wiry kid he’d been beating on for nearly three years caught him entirely off guard.  His hesitation led to a delayed reaction that led to his nose exploding with blood as Zeke’s knuckles landed cleanly.  Jack’s eyes instantly began watering profusely, temporarily blinding the bully so that he did not see the mix of horror and pain on Zeke’s face.

The intense pain in his wrist was quickly forgotten even as Zeke cradled his hand to his chest and wondered how anyone ever threw a second punch in a fight if the first one hurt this bad. His brain was overcome with only one recurring thought while he stared dumbfounded at the bully with a hand to his nose, blood dripping through his beefy fingers.  What the hell had he been thinking? 

 What the hell had he been THINKING? 


“I’m…I’m sorr–” he began to stammer but was cut off as Jack pulled himself up to his full height,  the rage in his watering eyes removing Zeke’s ability to speak.  The heavyset boy stalked towards Zeke, who had been backing up towards the coop after throwing the punch, like a bear approaching an injured deer in the forest. 

“GRRRRRRRRR” 

A rumbling growl from behind Zeke pulled Jack up short.  In the insanity of the moment, neither boy noticed the enormous dog –no, it was too big to be a dog, was it a wolf?-- that had come from seemingly nowhere.  Short, corded black hair covered the animal and his yellow eyes and two-inch-long canines promised a painful death should his warning not be heeded.

Frozen in fear, Zeke slowly turned and then stood transfixed as the animal approached him, teeth bared.  He screamed and put his arms up when he saw the animal begin a lunge.  

Nothing happened.

A loud crash from behind him found Zeke peaking through the hole in his arms to see Jack plowing through a garden fence, becoming entangled in the tomato cages and furiously trying to extricate himself all while still attempting to run away and whimpering like a scared puppy.  

Zeke waited for the attack, paralyzed with terror and furious that Jack was going to escape and he was going to die here.

Nothing happened.

After a few moments, he slowly straightened up and turned to look at the gigantic beast who just seemed to be staring at him quizzically.  

“I am proud of you, boy,” the animal said.

Zeke promptly passed out.

Upon awakening, his first thoughts were of the joy he would experience if his dreams actually happened in real life.  He could do without the talking wolf dog thing and the fear, but he would love to see Jack pissing his pants like that!  And he would really, really, REALLY love to punch Jack in the face once and for all.  

The throbbing pain in his wrist jolted him back into the moment.  Why did his wrist hurt? He felt the itchy sensation he got when his skin touched grass….what the hell? he thought.  Why was he sleeping in the yard? 

The sound of rocks in a tumbler pulled his attention back toward the chicken coop.  He let out a yelp and began scrambling away on his hands and feet when he saw the large dog from his dream standing there. 

“I am not a dog. I am a wolf,” it said in a deliberate baritone.  

“W….W…W…Wh,” Zeke attempted to speak but his mouth refused. 

When his backpedaling landed him against the house with a *THUNK* all he could think to do was run and hide.  He fumbled with the patio door and immediately locked and bolted it once he managed to get inside.  He was running on instinct, all he could think about was that a giant wolf spoke to him.  He must have snapped.  This couldn’t be real.  Zeke made his way to his room without once thinking about his chickens or Jack.  What was he supposed to do now? 

He slid back the curtains just a touch to look into the yard.  There it was, laying at the tree line, watching the house intently without a care in the world.  

Should he call his parents and tell them? 

Call animal control? 

Call Joyce? She always had her face in a fantasy novel, maybe she would know what the hell was going on. 

 Maybe go out there and talk to it? Was he even considering that this was real? What the hell was wrong with him?
