The question initially caught Zach off guard, that’s why he was so eager to agree with the idea of this…bond, was it?...turning into a regular dog.  It took just a beat for the reality of the situation to come crashing down around his ears. 

“It doesn’t matter,” he sighed in resignation.  “I can’t explain a random dog to my parents and they sure as hell aren’t going to let me keep one.” 

“Zachary!” Joyce began with real anger in her voice. “I have had enough of this defeatist attitude of yours.  You, LITERALLY, are the chosen one, hero-person in this scenario and all you can do is come up with reasons why it won’t work out? What the actual fudge is wrong with you!?”

Ixanae’s low chuckle at Joyce’s words was just as bad her rebuke for Zach. He couldn’t help it, this pessimism had served him well for his 17 years. It was not a habit easily broken. He looked helplessly at his friend with an expression of complete resignation and shrugged his bony shoulders. 

“Oh my god, Zach.  You are hopeless!” she said, throwing her hands wildly into the air.  “Doesn’t your cousin do some kind of dog rescue?”

“Yea…” 

“Don’t you always tell me that she’s the uber-cool, understanding member of your family?” 

“Yea…” 

“Holy sheets, Zach.  Do I really need to spell this out for you?” she asked incredulously.

He met the question with a vacant look.  He really had no idea where she was going with this, he couldn’t think past the next 20 minutes, if he was being honest.  Unbidden, his thoughts drifted to how woefully inept he was in any sort of crisis.  He was so thankful to have Joyce, even if she was verbally berating him at the moment.

She stared at him expectantly for another few seconds before continuing.  “She runs a Pitbull rescue, right?”

He nodded.

“Ok…,” she gestured as if to help him along with her meaning.

All he had for her was the same blank stare.

She sighed heavily and muttered something about the worst person ever to become the chosen one, then she continued, “Zach, call your ding dang cousin, tell her you need a huge favor and to cover for you when your parents call her. Tell her you’ll explain everything when you can talk to her face to face and alone!” 

Zach had begun nodding as she laid out the plan for him. “You’re a genius, Joyce!” 

“Hello? Is someone back here? This is the Traverse City Police, I’m coming back there, no sudden moves, please.” The authoritative voice brooked no argument and both teens were dumbstruck. Neither had the time to think, let alone react to the command. 

The police officer came around the side of the house and looked up at the two of them.  “Hello, I’m officer Dunkirk, do you live here?” the burly cop asked with a hint of accusation in his tone. 

“I do,” Zach responded tersely.  “Is something wrong?” 

“We’ve had a report of a rabid animal attack at this address…” the officer continued as he walked around the deck to get a better view of the yard.  

It did not escape Zach’s notice that his hand was on his service weapon and it looked like the strap holding the gun had been unsnapped. 

In terror, and without a conscious thought, he shifted his gaze to where Ixanae had been sitting a moment before and the officer instantly followed his eyes.  To Zach’s confused amazement, there was now a much smaller, deep black, pitbull puppy where the giant cyna-whatever was before.  

Joyce chose this moment to finally gather herself together again.  “Hardly,” she scoffed.  “That boy who made that call has been bullying Zach,” –she gestured to her friend– “for years.  Zach finally stood up to him and he’s trying to save face with some made up story.”

Zach realized she hadn’t looked over and seen Ixanae’s transformation yet so added, “he’s just a puppy, you can pet him if you want, he’s very friendly.” It was a gamble but Zach figured Iggy –a name that had just popped in his head– wouldn’t mind playing along.  

To his utter relief, the puppy bounded over to the officer, tail-wagging and tongue flying free.  The man’s countenance changed completely when he saw the adorable dog and he bent over to scratch the puppy’s ears. 

“Good for you, son,” he said to Zach.  “I’ll be sure to pass along the situation along to the dispatcher so that we can make sure that boy understands the gravity of filing a false report.” He made a motion like a half salute and left without another word. 

He and Joyce let out a collective breath of relief when they heard the car pull out of the driveway.  

“That was amazing, Iggy!” Zach exclaimed. “You saved us!’ 

“Iggy?” the puppy groaned.  “That will not be what you call me, my name is Ixanae.” 

Joyce was having none of this.  “Yes, it is! I love it! You’re just going to have to deal Iggy.  You need a regular name and that fits you perfectly.

He huffed but didn’t object again. 

“Zach, call your cousin, now!” Joyce ordered.  “Your parents are gonna be home soon, right? We need a plausible explanation for you having a puppy A-S-A-P”

Zach, although reeling from the emotional rollercoaster of the day, didn’t hesitate to comply with the threat of his parents arrival looming large in his thoughts. 

The conversation was quick. His cousin could sense the urgency and it helped that he was the very last person in his family that would ever be in trouble.  She knew that he wouldn’t be asking if he didn’t really need her to come through for him.  It also helped that she knew how much he had to deal with socially and had been suggesting a dog for him for quite a while. None of that saved Zach from having to promise to explain everything the next time they saw each other, though.  He didn’t know what he was going to tell her, but he would cross that bridge when he came to it. 

They agreed that a story that would play on his parent's emotions would be their best bet.  She concocted a tale that had someone abandoning a puppy at her door, not uncommon in the rescue biz she insisted, and leaving her with one too many dogs for the number of foster homes she currently relied on.  In a fit of panic, she had begged Zach to help her out for a few weeks until she could find a more permanent home for the pup.  

They both knew his parents wouldn’t have the heart to make Zach give the dog back.  They would probably be angry, but Zach would promise to take on all the responsibility and they would acquiesce in due order.

After the call, Zach, Joyce, and Iggy sat in his room in a heavy silence, the two teens trying to wrap their heads around the day and the dog organizing his thoughts for the conversation that needed to happen next.  

“We need to find the book,” he began. “I can explain everything but it is imperative that we perform the ritual of the bonding as soon as we possibly can.”

“What book?” Joyce asked. 

“It doesn’t have a name.  It is the book granted to us by the guardians that created my kind and bonded us to yours.  It contains a ritual that will complete my bond with Zach and unlock the dormant power of his soul for the battle to come.”

“What battle?!” Zach shrieked.  

“I will explain as we move. We must perform the ritual before our enemy arrives and I do not know how long we have.”

“Listen Iggy, I understand we’ve come some major supernatural sheets happening here, but you need to understand that we have to explain all of this to Zach’s parents before we do anything else. They will ground him forever if we just disappear now.  He won’t be fighting any battles if he’s not allowed out of the house will he?” Joyce countered.  

“We are speaking of the end of life on this planet and you are worried about his parents grounding him?” the puppy asked. 

“Yes,” Zach interjected. “I’m not 18 Iggy, they can literally make it so I can’t leave or do anything.  We have to explain.”

“Can you not have your cousin call them?” Iggy asked. 

“I guess…” Zach conceded. “But how will I explain leaving? It’s the afternoon already. That’s really out of character for me.” 

Joyce looked thoughtful for a moment then said, “you can tell them you went into town with me.” 

Zach looked back and forth between the two of them. “I really think I need to stay here until they get home…”
